A brief introduction describing what the current project is and what skills you will have demonstrated once you have completed it.

This project involves creating a simple webpage that links to some of my favorite recipes. 

The skills demonstrated in this project are as folllows:
        1. Set up new repository in GitHub and moved to my local machine using SSH in the terminal.
        2. Created new files and set up file structure by creating directories using terminal commands.
        3. Created a website that contains relative links to other pages on the website, uses absolute links to link images to website, and contains elements such as: headings, paragraphs, ordered and unordered lists, image, anchor, and what is known as the "boilerplate" elements.
